                            <p class="text-justify">By plotting latitude versus longitude, we can observe addition patterns in weather by location.
                                For example, local patterns are observed by geographic regions. For example, humidity
                                and wind speed appear to be generally higher in coastal regions when compared to inland
                                regions.
                               <br>
                               <br>
                                For this project, 3 different sets of data were pulled into one data frame, the current weather
                                at time of request, the weather at the highest temperature forecasted at three hour intervals
                                in the next 24 hours from time of request, and the average of the selected weather parameters
                                forecasted in intervals of 3 hours for the next 5 days (120 hours) from time of request.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                                Initially, the hypothesis was that current weather would give you skewed information based
                                on longitude and time of day, while the forecasted weather may not be as accurate. The
                                belief was that pulling information only from the forecasted maximized temperature over
                                a 24 hours period would minimize this effect, but also might skew additional parameters
                                like cloud cover and wind speed. Surprisingly, no noticeable difference was experienced
                                between these two groups.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                The average values over the next 5 days/120h hours did yield slightly different results, but
                                might not allow us to inspect addition relationships accurately. For example, to inspect
                                temperature versus wind speed exact data points may be more beneficial than the average
                                values. This information, however, may not be as accurate as current data or a 24 hours
                                forecast.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                                Using 24 hour data, we can see that cities on or very near the equator did not experience
                                the highest temperatures, although high temperatures were more consistent in that area
                                and there was slightly less variability. The highest temperatures where instead experienced
                                closer to the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, located at 23.5 and -23.5 degrees latitude
                                respectively. This phenomenon and variability may be due to the differences in the number
                                of cities that fall along these latitudes as well as the geographic features. For example, the
                                Sahara Desert falls along the Tropic of Cancer (see graphs at the end of document). Instead,
                                it is safer to conclude that the highest temperatures were experienced between latitudes of
                                -30 and 30 degrees, although with generally more variability as you increase distance from
                                0 degrees latitude. Using the average temperature parameter, we can see more consistency
                                between -20 and 20 degrees latitude.
                            <br>

                                Percent humidity doesnâ€™t seem to have much correlation to latitude. Several varying latitudes
                                have % humidity ranging from 40 to 100%. However, based on this small date sampling,
                                humidity does experience variation as we approach the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn with some falling below 40% humidity. The cities on the equator experienced the 40%
                                to 100% range. No significant correlation was found between latitude and cloud cover or
                                wind speed. Frequency of wind speed, however, can be observed. The most common observation
                                was speeds between 0 and 10 mph. Observations decrease in frequency as you
                                increase wind speed with rare occurrences of wind speeds greater than 30 mph.
